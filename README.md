# complex-tdd-draft
This is test-driven development for a complex number draft.

It returns the value of the complex class in json format.
Instead of directly developing a complex class, I preferred to start from its components.
Both the real part and the coefficient of the imaginary part return their value in json format.
Once you have downloaded the generic project template generated on the Spring Initializr website, with the specific requests that can be deduced from the pom file, you can import it into your preferred IDE and add the source files found here.
Please give attention to the correct Java language package system.
Thank you.
